# Public, reproducible path (classic Bing Web Search)
# Used by: src/providers/bing.py  (the "bing" provider)

# If the reviewer has a Bing Web Search key, they can put it here or export it as an env var.

# Use ONE of these for the endpoint:
# 1) Global Bing API (works with consumer Web Search keys):
BING_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://api.bing.microsoft.com
# 2) If the reviewer happens to have an Azure Cognitive Services Bing Web Search resource, they can set:
# BING_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource>.cognitiveservices.azure.com

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT put an Azure "Grounding with Bing Search" key here.
# That key only works inside Azure AI Foundry Agents and will NOT authenticate the 'bing' provider.


# ================================
# Optional: Azure AI Foundry Agents + Grounding with Bing Search
# NOT used by src/providers/bing.py. This is for a future 'azure-agents' provider.
# See docs/AZURE_AGENTS.md for the flow.
